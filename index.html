            <h2>His Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Juan Palomar, MD trained in Spain and the United States, becoming an early pioneer in Pediatric Urology. For five decades, he treated infants and adults using fluoroscopy for complex urological conditions — work that exposed him to scatter ionizing radiation, especially during procedures like cystoscopy and ureteroscopy where the surgeon sits on a stool in the operating room positioned between the patient's legs, often only a foot or two from the fluoroscopy tube. In pediatric cases, particularly with infants, that distance can shrink to just inches. His exposures occurred at a time when protective standards were inadequate and these standards remain outdated even today.</p>
                <p>In 2017, Juan was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive, chordoma in the center of his brain. He knew immediately that it was due to decades of ionizing radiation exposure from fluoroscopy. Despite extensive treatment, he died 11 months later, leaving behind his wife, young daughter, and a community who loved him. His story mirrors a long-standing pattern among physicians in Urology and other fluoroscopy-dependent specialties who continue to face preventable scatter ionizing radiation exposure due to insufficient safety standards. Their losses reveal a preventable occupational hazard that demands urgent attention.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>A Boyhood Dream</h3>
                    <p>Juan Palomar, MD knew from the time he was a young boy that he wanted to be a surgeon. After studying at the University of Navarra in Spain, he came to the United States and completed his urological residency at Tulane. He became an early U.S. pioneer in Pediatric Urology and worked at several hospitals in the Dayton area in both adult and pediatric urology.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Decades of Fluoroscopy Exposure</h3>
                    <p>As fluoroscopy technology advanced, Juan used it to treat infants with ureteral filling defects and adults with kidney, ureteral, and bladder cancers, as well as urological stone disease and countless other complex conditions. Many of these procedures required him to work extremely close to the patient. During cystoscopy, for example, the surgeon sits on a stool in the operating room positioned between the patient's legs while guiding the scope. When fluoroscopy is used, the X-ray tube is directly over the patient — placing the urologist only a foot or two from where scatter ionizing radiation is released. In pediatric cases, especially with infants, that distance can shrink to just inches.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Inadequate Protection</h3>
                    <p>Like many physicians of his generation, Juan performed these procedures for decades without adequate head and full-body protection from scatter ionizing radiation — a risk that was, and still is, poorly - inconsistently regulated, and often minimized.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>In mid-2017, Juan began getting lost while driving to his surgical practice. What he believed was early dementia was instead a large tumor in the center of his brain. He immediately recognized what it represented: a lifetime of exposure to scatter ionizing radiation during fluoroscopic procedures without head protection. Surgery revealed a rare, never-before-diagnosed, extremely aggressive chordoma. Chordomas arise from remnants of the notochord — the embryonic structure present at 3–8 weeks of development that later forms the bony spine. The center of the brain has no bone tissue; consequently, his tumor would be classified as a mutation. Mutations occur via two distinct pathways: genetic or exposure. As his tumor was one of a kind, with no cases ever discovered, his was due to exposure — exposure to ionizing radiation from fluoroscopy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Fight</h3>
                    <p>Juan endured two brain surgeries and two months of daily proton beam radiation at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He also underwent Gamma Knife surgery in Ohio in an attempt to battle his brain cancer. Sadly, Juan died 11 months after his diagnosis. He left behind a young daughter and wife who still feel his loss daily, as well as a community of family, friends, and patients who adored him.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>A Pattern That Must End</h3>
                    <p>Juan's story is not an isolated tragedy. It reflects a continuous, decades-long pattern among physicians, clinicians, and ancillary staff — including those in Urology, General Surgery, Cardiology, Orthopedics, Interventional Radiology, and any field where fluoroscopy is utilized — who dedicated their lives to healing others while unknowingly absorbing scatter ionizing radiation in operating rooms, hospitals, surgery centers, mobile ESWL suites, and clinics. Their experiences — and their losses — reveal a preventable occupational hazard that demands urgent attention.</p>

                    <h2>A Life Beyond Medicine</h2>
                    <p>Juan was not only a dedicated physician but also a passionate winemaker. In 2002, he founded Dominio Buenavista in his native Granada, Spain, producing wines under the Veleta label. The project began in 1992 when he and his wife Nola planted the first vines at the familial estate of the Palomar family, overlooking the village of Ugijar below the snow-capped Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p>
                    <p class="winery-quote">"A true gentleman and a lover of good food and good wine who loved to share that passion with others."</p>
                    <p>His goal was simple yet ambitious: to grow grapes and make wines similar to those from California's Napa Valley. In addition to Spanish varietals like tempranillo, he planted cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, and chardonnay.</p>
                    <div class="winery-award">
                        <strong>Legacy of Excellence:</strong> Less than six months after Juan's passing, the Veleta winery collected medals including a coveted double-gold at the 2018 San Francisco International Wine Competition — a testament to his passion and skill.
